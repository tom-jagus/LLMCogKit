# LLMCogKit

**LLMCogKit** is a modular, open-source toolkit for defining and managing how large language models (LLMs) interact with you — across platforms, sessions, and use cases. This framework empowers users to generate portable, reusable, and structured profiles that shape assistant behavior through Markdown-based configurations.

Rather than relying on isolated prompts or vendor-specific settings, LLMCogKit enables you to build a durable, human-centered interaction model — whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned AI user.

## 🎯 Who It's For

- **Professionals** seeking predictable, reliable LLM behavior
- **New LLM users** who want structured onboarding and guidance
- **Teams** standardizing assistant behavior across tools and workflows
- **Consultants** creating repeatable interaction profiles for multiple clients or projects

---

## 🧩 What It Includes

- **Conversational Setup Templates** – guided intake for customization, memory, and persona definition
- **Modular Output Files** – including `customization.md`, `memory_seed.md`, `persona_*.md`
- **Unified `profile.md` Generator** – merge files into a single config usable across LLMs
- **Persona Switching Support** – change roles mid-session based on context
- **Onboarding Companion Layer** – step-by-step user guide and platform usage instructions
- **Cross-Platform Adaptability** – prepare profiles for tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Notion, and more

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Out-of-the-box LLMs are powerful but unpredictable. LLMCogKit helps you:

- Eliminate the need for repetitive prompt engineering
- Maintain consistent tone, formatting, and memory
- Version and reuse your setup across platforms and sessions
- Empower non-technical users with structured personalization
