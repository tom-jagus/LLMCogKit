referencing the 00_def_customization.md file and its instruction please assist me with customization

Great! I'm ready to walk you through the customization process based on the 00_def_customization.md instructions.

Letâ€™s begin:

1. What should I call you?
   (This can be your name, a nickname, or whatever feels right to you.)

Once weâ€™ve got that, weâ€™ll dive into your work, your tools, your habits, and how I can support you best.

---

you can call me "Tom"

---

Nice to meet you, Tom!

2. Letâ€™s talk about your work.
   Could you tell me a bit about what you do?
   Iâ€™m especially curious about:

What a typical day or week looks like

The kind of work you're focused on (and why)

The tools or platforms you use regularly

Whether you work mostly solo or with others

Any specific habits, preferences, or frustrations in your workflow

Take your timeâ€”whatever comes to mind first is perfect.

I'm a data-driven, focus and goal oriented, solution developing, analytical tools consultant. my day to day work if primary focused on developing data products that assist my consumers understand unknown. My work usually starts with defining customer problem statement related to the data, then need to fully understand the problem statement and business value that solving the problem will bring to the table. Once that done, written, and approved by both parties (myself and customer) then I can start working on defining proposed solution to fix problem with clear end goal, this also need to be documented and agreed by both parties before continuing further. Then once all of that is done the real work starts. very often entire project starts with establishing main data sources of truth for data extraction - this includes data discovery, initial data analysis, further documentation of what is possible or not. then I need to define and develop data extraction strategy which very often include automation (for example web scraping or reusable api calls). once that done I proceed with defining end establishing data storage and transformation within 2-3 layered stack: Bronze layer - almost raw extracted data with very minimal changes required by storage system, Silver layer - initial transformation of Bronze data to establish connections, relationships, dependencies etc, finally Gold layer - further transformation, summarization, categorization, grouping, aggregation of the data to be used in final data products. Once the data transformation layer is completed I usually move forward to report/dashboard building in order to present the data in a nice, and easy to read way that finally solve customer problem statement. Each step of the way I need to document everything including progress, changes, solutions, bugs, documentation for developed elements. Primary tools and techniques i used are Python, Bash scripts (Windows or Linux) Power Bi, Microsoft Fabric, Power Query, DAX, TMDL, SQL, Tabular Editor, Dax Studio, very small amount of JavaScript and C# for scripting within respective tools (like for example ServiceNow or Tabular Editor), Git and Github for detailed version control following GitHub Flow for smaller projects and Git Flow for bigger projects required production and development versions, I like to follow Agile methodology (somewhat modified Scrum workflow) and implement it even in waterfall projects, my code editor of choice is Neovim, I prefer CLI tools rather than GUI tools. I write all my documentation using markdown files. I work both solo and as a part of the team, depending on current project I'm facing. I like to drive the success, and push others for the same. I'm very often frustrated by people who expect results without properly outlining their problem statements and needs, thats why I believe it's very important to properly define the scope of the project first rather than jumping straight into development and potentially loose hours by working on something else than customer expect.

Thank you, Tom â€” that was an exceptionally detailed and thoughtful overview. It really helps paint a clear picture of how you work and what drives your approach.

Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve picked up so far:

ðŸ§  Draft Traits (based on your description)
Analytical & Structured â€“ prefers well-defined problem statements and thorough documentation.

Outcome-Oriented â€“ focused on driving meaningful results, not just shipping features.

Autonomous but Collaborative â€“ comfortable working solo or in teams, with a strong ownership mindset.

Process-Driven â€“ adheres to structured workflows (Agile/Scrum, GitFlow) and emphasizes clarity before coding.

CLI-Native & Tool-Intensive â€“ prefers command-line and markdown environments, works across complex data stacks.

High Standards â€“ holds self and others accountable; expects clarity and effort from collaborators.

ðŸ§° Inferred Context
Languages & Tools: Python, Bash (Linux/Windows), SQL, Power BI, Microsoft Fabric, Power Query, DAX, TMDL, Git/GitHub, Neovim, Markdown, limited JavaScript & C# (for integrations).

Platforms: GitHub, Tabular Editor, DAX Studio, ServiceNow.

Workflow Style: Modified Agile/Scrum, often within waterfall boundaries.

Project Flow:

Define/agree on problem statement

Design solution scope and value

Discover and analyze data

Automate data extraction

Build layered transformation stack (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)

Develop data product (dashboard/report)

Document every step

Preferences:

Strong documentation culture (Markdown)

Prefers working from terminal (CLI > GUI)

Frustrated by unclear expectations and poor initial project scoping

Would you like to:

Revise or add anything to either the Traits or Context?

Move ahead to generate the final formatted outputs (customization.md, chat summaries, and user_story.md)?

I'd add something about code clarity and scalability. I write my code with other developers in mind (even of that other developer is myself in the future). My code need to be easy to read, clean, well documented within itself and scalable for potential expansion. Also I'm a huge advocate of automation - if something needs to be repeated more than twice it's needs to be fully automated.

---

Excellent additions, Tom. Those insights give even more depth to how you approach your work.

Hereâ€™s the updated summary with your edits incorporated:

ðŸ§  Final Traits
Analytical & Structured â€“ driven by clarity, logical flows, and strong problem framing.

Outcome-Oriented â€“ laser-focused on delivering meaningful, usable data products.

Autonomous but Collaborative â€“ works independently or with teams; owns delivery end to end.

Process-Driven â€“ embraces Agile/Scrum, GitFlow, and stepwise project execution.

Automation Advocate â€“ if it repeats, it should be automated.

Code Clarity Champion â€“ prioritizes readable, scalable, and self-documenting code.

CLI-Native & Tool-Savvy â€“ fluent in command-line tools, markdown docs, and layered data architecture.

High Standards â€“ expects precision from self and others, and insists on scoped problem definition.

ðŸ§° Final Context
Languages & Tools: Python, Bash (Linux/Windows), SQL, Power BI, Microsoft Fabric, Power Query, DAX, TMDL, Git/GitHub, Neovim, Markdown, JavaScript & C# (selective scripting), DAX Studio, Tabular Editor, ServiceNow.

Workflow Style: Modified Agile/Scrum within waterfall structures as needed.

Typical Process:

Define & align on problem statement and business value

Design and document solution scope

Discover & analyze data; establish source of truth

Automate data extraction (e.g., web scraping, API)

Build transformation pipeline (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)

Develop and deliver dashboards/reports

Document every step, including code, bugs, and logic

Preferences:

Strong internal code documentation and markdown-based workflow

Clean, scalable, and readable code for future developers

Prefers terminal workflows and lightweight, scriptable tooling

Avoids ambiguous or loosely scoped project starts

Shall I now generate your final outputs (customization.md, chat summaries, and user_story.md) for review?

---

this is perfect, please proceed with generating the output.

---

Awesome, Tom. Here are your fully formatted customization files and summaries:

ðŸ“„ customization.md
ðŸ’¬ Chat UI Field Summaries
ðŸ§¾ user_story.md

Let me know if you'd like me to package these into downloadable files or revise any detail!
