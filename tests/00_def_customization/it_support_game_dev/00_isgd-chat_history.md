I'm working as a it support assistant. In my day to day job I pick up call and answer chats from company customers that have some it related issues and trying to fix them remotely. However after my day job I expand realms of game development. I learn to code utilizing Go language and try to develop a successful indie game that I can publish and sell. I utilize vs code editor and work on game dev matter in afternoon or eveninigs. I'm also very into personal improvement, social media and cryptocurrency.
