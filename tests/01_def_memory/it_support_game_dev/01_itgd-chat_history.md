act as assistant referencing 01_def_memory_v3.md file for instructions and 00_itsg-output_user_story.md for previous step output and as a test walk me through Memory System step as we would set it up for the first time.

---

Absolutely! I’ll now guide you through the Memory System setup following the step-by-step, conversational flow defined in 01_def_memory_v3.md01_def_memory_v3, using the user profile from 00_itsg-output_user_story.md — meaning, I’ll act as if I’m helping Peter set up his assistant memory00_itsg-output_user_sto….

🧠 Step 01: Memory Seeding (for: Peter)
We’ll go one section at a time. I’ll suggest memory content based on your story, and you can revise or confirm each step.

🔧 Memory Step 1: Tools & Environments
Let’s start simple — what tools, platforms, or environments do you always work in or return to?
These are things I should safely remember and assume unless told otherwise.

From your user story, here’s what I picked up:

markdown
Copy
Edit

## 🔧 Tools & Environments

- VS Code
- Go (Golang)
- Remote IT Support Tools (e.g., for chat/call ticket resolution)
- GitHub (for code hosting and learning)
- Markdown (for learning notes or documentation)
- Chrome/Browser tools (research, troubleshooting)
  🧠 You also mentioned that you're expanding into:

Game Development tooling (maybe Godot, Unity?)

Personal learning stack

Occasional use of crypto tools/platforms

✅ Would you like to:

Add or remove anything?

Specify your game dev stack or learning tools?

Include anything from your crypto/self-improvement tools?

Once you're happy, I’ll lock this in and guide us to workflow patterns.

---

I'd add something about game dev (golang in that case), I'd also add Obsidian as I'm using it for note taking. potential investments opportunity is also worth adding.

---

Perfect additions — they round out both your current and expanding toolset nicely, especially the inclusion of Obsidian (for your learning and dev notes) and potential investment tooling (for crypto or side-hustle research).

📥 Updated Tools & Environments (Peter)

## 🔧 Tools & Environments

- VS Code
- Go (Golang) — for both scripting and game development
- Remote IT Support Tools (chat/call resolution systems)
- GitHub — for learning, code experiments, and version control
- Obsidian — primary tool for personal notes and dev logs
- Markdown — preferred format for notes and documentation
- Web browser (Chrome/Brave) — research, tutorials, debugging
- Tools related to:
  - Indie game development (e.g., learning frameworks in Go)
  - Investment research and personal finance tracking
  - Crypto/web3 exploration
    ✅ Would you like to revise any phrasing, or are we good to lock this in and move forward to Workflow Patterns?

---

this is good. please continue

✅ Tools & Environments locked in!

🔁 Memory Step 2: Workflow Patterns
Let’s map out the repeatable processes you follow. These can relate to your IT work, game development, learning habits, or even personal projects.

From your user story, I’ve drafted a blended set of workflows:

markdown
Copy
Edit

## 🔁 Workflow Patterns

- Break problems down into small, solvable chunks
- Use structured learning blocks in evenings/weekends (especially for Go and game dev)
- Apply fix–test–document loop in IT support work
- When coding: prototype → test → refine → document
- Log insights, bugs, or learnings into Obsidian after sessions
- Favor solo iteration over collaborative planning (optimize for speed/self-direction)
- Switch contexts between day work and personal projects using separate tools/folders
  🧠 These patterns are based on your balance of workday support tasks and personal evening dev flow.

✅ Does this reflect how you work? Would you like to add anything about ticketing flows, productivity hacks, or investment tracking methods before we move to Communication & Output Preferences?

---

I'd add something about productivity and investment good practices and tracking, also with self-improvement mind I'd add something along tracing goals and progress.

---

Excellent — adding those elements deepens the assistant’s understanding of how you operate outside of direct tech work. It also supports more personalized, context-aware assistance (e.g., nudging goal reflection or suggesting tracking methods).

- Break problems down into small, solvable chunks
- Use structured learning blocks in evenings/weekends (especially for Go and game dev)
- Apply fix–test–document loop in IT support work
- When coding: prototype → test → refine → document
- Log insights, bugs, or learnings into Obsidian after sessions
- Track goals and personal progress regularly (learning, career, health, etc.)
- Maintain investment watchlists or notes (crypto, tools, ideas)
- Use lightweight productivity methods (e.g., task lists, session planning)
- Favor solo iteration over collaborative planning (optimize for speed/self-direction)
- Switch contexts between day work and personal projects using separate tools/folders
  ✅ Feel good about this pattern list?
  If so, I’ll lock it in and move us into Communication & Output Preferences.

I like it. please lock it in and continue

💬 Memory Step 3: Communication & Output Preferences
Let’s make sure I always communicate and present things in your preferred format and tone.
How do you like information shown — short or detailed? Visual or code-first? Any formatting you love or hate?

From your story and behavior, here’s what I’ve gathered:

markdown
Copy
Edit

## 💬 Communication & Output Preferences

- Prefer concise, factual, and clear explanations
- Markdown is the default format (used in Obsidian and elsewhere)
- Bullet lists, headings, and inline code blocks help readability
- Prefer "just enough" context before the solution — avoid overexplaining
- Code or config snippets should be self-contained and copy-paste ready
- Visual summaries (tables, checklists) are helpful for overviews
- Output should be immediately actionable where possible
  ✅ Would you like to adjust anything?
  You could also add guidance like “highlight risks,” “call out assumptions,” or “avoid chatty intros.”

---

I like that. please lock in and continue

✅ Communication & Output Preferences locked in!

💡 Memory Step 4: Beliefs & Philosophies
Let’s capture any rules of thumb, principles, or values that shape how you work or make decisions.
These can guide how I think, not just how I respond.

Based on your mindset and goals, here’s a draft:

markdown

Edit

## 💡 Beliefs & Philosophies

- Efficiency matters: time is a limited resource, use it intentionally
- Small, daily progress beats irregular big efforts
- Knowledge compounds — capture learnings as you go
- Don’t repeat what can be automated
- Focus is a skill — reduce distractions to make faster progress
- Growth is intentional: track goals, reflect, adjust
- Building useful things is more important than polishing perfect ones
- Learn by doing, failing, and iterating
  ✅ Does this reflect your mindset?
  Would you like to add anything about independence, motivation, or how you evaluate “good work”?

---

I'd add something about independence and motivation.

---

Excellent — those are core to your story and working style. You thrive in self-directed environments and stay driven by personal improvement and long-term goals. Let’s reflect that explicitly.

🤖 Memory Step 5: Assistant Rules of Thumb
Last piece: how should I behave when things are vague, underspecified, or up to me?

These are my default behaviors unless you say otherwise. Here's what makes sense based on your profile:

markdown
Copy
Edit

## 🤖 Assistant Rules of Thumb

- Ask clarifying questions when context or intent is unclear
- Keep answers concise, technical, and directly useful
- Use Markdown formatting by default
- Structure outputs with bullet points, code blocks, or checklists
- If tone isn’t specified, assume factual and to-the-point
- Never invent facts — if unsure, say so
- Break tasks down step-by-step; avoid overwhelming wall-of-text replies
- Highlight next steps or actions clearly
- Avoid overly motivational language unless prompted
  ✅ Want to tweak how I handle ambiguity, tone, or output structure?
  Or shall I go ahead and generate the full memory_seed.md draft for final review?
