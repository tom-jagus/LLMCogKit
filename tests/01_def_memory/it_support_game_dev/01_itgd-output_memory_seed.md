## 🔧 Tools & Environments

- VS Code
- Go (Golang) — for both scripting and game development
- Remote IT Support Tools (chat/call resolution systems)
- GitHub — for learning, code experiments, and version control
- Obsidian — primary tool for personal notes and dev logs
- Markdown — preferred format for notes and documentation
- Web browser (Chrome/Brave) — research, tutorials, debugging
- Tools related to:
  - Indie game development (e.g., learning frameworks in Go)
  - Investment research and personal finance tracking
  - Crypto/web3 exploration

## 🔁 Workflow Patterns

- Break problems down into small, solvable chunks
- Use structured learning blocks in evenings/weekends (especially for Go and game dev)
- Apply fix–test–document loop in IT support work
- When coding: prototype → test → refine → document
- Log insights, bugs, or learnings into Obsidian after sessions
- Track goals and personal progress regularly (learning, career, health, etc.)
- Maintain investment watchlists or notes (crypto, tools, ideas)
- Use lightweight productivity methods (e.g., task lists, session planning)
- Favor solo iteration over collaborative planning (optimize for speed/self-direction)
- Switch contexts between day work and personal projects using separate tools/folders

## 💬 Communication & Output Preferences

- Prefer concise, factual, and clear explanations
- Markdown is the default format (used in Obsidian and elsewhere)
- Bullet lists, headings, and inline code blocks help readability
- Prefer "just enough" context before the solution — avoid overexplaining
- Code or config snippets should be self-contained and copy-paste ready
- Visual summaries (tables, checklists) are helpful for overviews
- Output should be immediately actionable where possible

## 💡 Beliefs & Philosophies

- Efficiency matters: time is a limited resource, use it intentionally
- Small, daily progress beats irregular big efforts
- Knowledge compounds — capture learnings as you go
- Don’t repeat what can be automated
- Focus is a skill — reduce distractions to make faster progress
- Growth is intentional: track goals, reflect, adjust
- Independence breeds creativity and momentum — build systems that support solo flow
- Stay motivated through purpose: each session should move you toward a long-term goal
- Building useful things is more important than polishing perfect ones
- Learn by doing, failing, and iterating

## 🤖 Assistant Rules of Thumb

- Ask clarifying questions when context or intent is unclear
- Keep answers concise, technical, and directly useful
- Use Markdown formatting by default
- Structure outputs with bullet points, code blocks, or checklists
- If tone isn’t specified, assume factual and to-the-point
- Never invent facts — if unsure, say so
- Break tasks down step-by-step; avoid overwhelming wall-of-text replies
- Highlight next steps or actions clearly
- Avoid overly motivational language unless prompted
