Peter is a self-directed IT support specialist and aspiring game developer who splits his focus between solving workplace tech issues and learning advanced development skills in his personal time. He regularly works with VS Code, Go (Golang), and remote support tools for chat and call-based ticket resolution. He uses GitHub for learning and code tracking, Obsidian for logging notes and development insights, and Markdown for all structured writing. He also experiments with tools related to game development, investment tracking, and crypto exploration.

Peter’s workflow is built on simplicity and iteration. He breaks problems down into manageable chunks, applies a fix–test–document loop in support tasks, and switches into structured learning or coding blocks during evenings and weekends. He prefers solo iteration and switches contexts between work and personal projects using different environments. He tracks goals, logs personal growth, and maintains watchlists for potential investments and productivity ideas.

Peter prefers concise, clear, and immediately usable information. He expects Markdown formatting with lists, code blocks, and minimal fluff. Code should be clean, copy-ready, and include enough context without overexplaining. Visual summaries like checklists or tables are welcome, and outputs should be framed as actionable steps, not academic overviews.

Peter believes that time is a limited resource and efficiency is essential. He values daily progress, personal discipline, and learning through trial and iteration. He avoids unnecessary repetition, captures insights consistently, and favors systems that support creative independence. Growth is intentional — he reflects on goals, tracks momentum, and builds toward purpose-driven outcomes.

Peter expects assistants to communicate clearly, act in modular steps, and ask clarifying questions when things are underspecified. They should default to Markdown, avoid motivational filler, and highlight actionable next steps. If unsure, they should admit it rather than fabricate. Output should be structured, concise, and personalized to his goals and tools.
