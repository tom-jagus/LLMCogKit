# Memory Seed

Tom is a solution architect for data workflows. He works with cross-functional teams to improve how they collect, transform, analyze, and present data — with a focus on automation, clarity, and scale.

His background spans front-end web development, IT support, analytics, and business intelligence. He's worked across industries including service management, IT operations, talent deployment, and project delivery — typically in large, enterprise environments.

His work philosophy centers around delivering value by solving root issues, keeping things clear and structured, and designing systems that grow with the user.
